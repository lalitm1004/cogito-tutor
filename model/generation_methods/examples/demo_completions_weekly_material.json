                    "explanation": "Game theory is fundamentally about the study of strategic interactions, where the decisions of one player affect the outcomes of another. Option A is incorrect because it is broader than economic systems. Option C is incorrect since it deals with emotions rather than strategic choices. Option D is irrelevant to game theory."

                    "option_A": "Each player chooses their dominant strategy, leading to a Pareto optimal outcome.",
                    "option_B": "No player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy given the other players' strategies.",

                    "answer": "B",
                    "explanation": "Option B defines the Nash Equilibrium correctly: players are at a point where no one can improve their payoff by changing strategy alone. Option A is incorrect because dominant strategies don't guarantee a Pareto optimal outcome. Option C describes cooperative games, not Nash Equilibrium. Option D misstates the predictability; players cannot always deterministically predict actions."

Option A is misleading as cooperation does not lead to the worst outcome; it is superior to mutual betrayal. Option B is false since mutual cooperation indeed yields better individual outcomes. Option D inaccurately generalizes the outcomes within the dilemma."

                    "option_C": "Strategies depend solely on the beliefs about the types of other players.",

                    "answer": "C",
                    "explanation": "Option C accurately captures the essence of Bayesian games, where players' strategies rely on their beliefs about others' types. Option A is only partially true; types also affect available strategies. Option B is incorrect; types can reveal varying degrees of information. Option D misconceives the interactivity; past moves can inform players' beliefs."

                    "explanation": "Option B correctly defines fitness in evolutionary game theory as related to reproductive success and strategy mix influence. Option A is too simplistic; strategy interacts with the population's dynamics. Option C is incorrect because fitness is crucial in determining evolutionary stability. Option D misrepresents fitness; under certain conditions, defection can perform better."

                    "option_B": "The core relies solely on individual rationality without considering group dynamics.",

                    "option_D": "The presence of a core means all players' payoffs will be increased compared to the non-cooperative scenario.",
                    "answer": "A",
                    "explanation": "Option A correctly asserts that the core can be empty if individuals cannot benefit more than participating in the grand coalition. Option B ignores the essence of cooperative behavior; group dynamics matter significantly. Option C is false; not all coalitions can achieve maximum payoffs. Option D mistakenly generalizes outcomes of cooperative games."

Option B misrepresents the nature of correlations; cooperation is mutual within the framework. Option C is incorrect as strategy revelation occurs post-game is not a definition despite communication being integral. Option D contrasts outcomes unjustly, as correlated equilibria can yield equal or higher payoffs."
